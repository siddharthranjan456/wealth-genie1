ðŸ“Œ Chunk 1: Risk Score Calculation in Wealth Genie
Wealth Genie uses a 13-question quiz to assess user risk tolerance. Each question contributes between 1 to 4 points based on the investorâ€™s willingness to take risk. The total score ranges from 13 to 52 and is mapped to a normalized scale between 0.0 and 1.0 using a piecewise linear function. This normalized risk score reflects how aggressive or conservative the investor is and directly affects portfolio optimization.

ðŸ“Œ Chunk 2: Risk Score Normalization Logic
Wealth Genie maps the raw score (13â€“52) to a normalized value using breakpoints:
- 0â€“18 â†’ scaled to 0â€“0.2  
- 18â€“22 â†’ scaled to 0.2â€“0.4  
- 22â€“28 â†’ scaled to 0.4â€“0.6  
- 28â€“32 â†’ scaled to 0.6â€“0.8  
- 32â€“45+ â†’ scaled to 0.8â€“1.0  
This transformation ensures that more risk-seeking users get higher risk weights in portfolio calculations.

ðŸ“Œ Chunk 3: Sentiment Analysis via Financial Indicators
Sentiment in Wealth Genie is inferred using price-based indicators such as:
- Daily returns  
- Moving Averages (MA20, MA50, MA200)  
- Momentum over 10, 30, and 90 days  
- Volatility (short and long-term)  
- RSI and MACD

These technical indicators represent market optimism or pessimism. They are standardized using `StandardScaler` and fed into pre-trained ML models that output future price predictions. The predicted return over the current price acts as a proxy for sentiment.

ðŸ“Œ Chunk 4: Predictive Sentiment in Action
Each ticker (e.g., AAPL, BTC-USD, GLD) is analyzed with up-to-date Yahoo Finance data. The model predicts a future price using engineered features. The return is calculated as:

Predicted Return (%) = (Predicted Price / Current Price - 1) Ã— 100

Positive returns reflect market optimism (bullish sentiment), and negative returns indicate bearish sentiment.

ðŸ“Œ Chunk 5: Modern Portfolio Theory in Wealth Genie
Wealth Genie applies MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory) to optimize asset allocation. The optimization goal is:

Minimize: -Return + Î» Ã— Risk

Where:
- Return = weights.dot(expected_returns)  
- Risk = weights.dot(covariance_matrix).dot(weights)  
- Î» = (1 - normalized_risk_score) Ã— 10

This equation balances the trade-off between maximizing returns and minimizing risk, adjusting dynamically based on the userâ€™s risk profile.

ðŸ“Œ Chunk 6: Asset Classes and Allocation
Assets in Wealth Genie are grouped into:
- Gold ETFs (e.g., GLD, IAU)  
- Stocks (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, AMZN)  
- Cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC-USD, ETH-USD)

The total investment amount is allocated proportionally using optimized weights from the mean-variance optimization process. Asset predictions guide which specific tickers are recommended based on predicted returns.
